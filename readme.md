####################bank_account.py, main_bank.py##############################
Class Definition:

Define a class named BankAccount.
Use the __init__ method to initialize an account_balance attribute. Optionally, accept an initial balance parameter, defaulting to zero.
Encapsulation and Behaviors:

Implement deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), and display_balance() methods.
deposit should add the specified amount to account_balance.
withdraw should deduct the amount from account_balance if funds are sufficient, returning True; otherwise, return False and do not alter the balance.
display_balance should print the current balance in a user-friendly format.
main-0.py for Command Line Interaction:
This script utilizes BankAccount through command line arguments for banking operations.

###################division_calculator, main_division.py########################
Create two Python scripts: robust_division_calculator.py, which contains the division logic including error handling, and main.py, which interfaces with the user through the command line.

robust_division_calculator.py:
Define a function safe_divide(numerator, denominator) that performs division, handling potential errors:

Division by Zero: Use a try-except block to catch ZeroDivisionError.
Non-numeric Input: Attempt to convert arguments to floats. Use a try-except block to catch ValueError for non-numeric inputs.
Return appropriate messages for errors or the result for successful division.
main.py for Command Line Interaction:
This script will import safe_divide from robust_division_calculator.py and use it to divide numbers provided as command line arguments.

######################simple_calculator.py, calculator_test##########################
Task: Write Unit Tests in test_simple_calculator.py
Create a test_simple_calculator.py script to define and run unit tests for each method in the SimpleCalculator class. Your tests should cover various scenarios to ensure the class functions correctly.

Guidelines for Writing Tests:
Import the Necessary Modules:

Import the unittest module and the SimpleCalculator class from simple_calculator.py.
Define a Test Class:

Create a test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase.
Write Test Methods:

Write at least one test method for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) provided by the SimpleCalculator.
Include tests for edge cases, such as dividing by zero.
Use Assertions to Verify Results:

Utilize self.assertEqual() to check for expected outcomes.
For the divide method, ensure you test both normal operation and division by zero.
Running Your Tests:

Run your tests using the command line: python -m unittest test_simple_calculator.py

####################library.py, main_library#######################
Your Task: library_management.py
Implement a Book class with public attributes title and author, and a private attribute _is_checked_out to track its availability.
Implement a Library class with a private list _books to store instances of Book. Include methods to add_book, check_out_book(title), return_book(title), and list_available_books.
Provided for Testing: main.py
This script demonstrates how to interact with your Book and Library classes.

######################shopping.py###################################
Create a Python script named shopping_list_manager.py that implements a simple interface for managing a shopping list. This task focuses on using lists to store and manipulate data dynamically.

Requirements:
Core Functionality:

Your script should start with an empty list named shopping_list.
Implement functionality to add items to the list, remove items, and display the current list.
User Interface:

Use a loop to continuously display a menu with options to the user until they choose to exit. The menu should offer options to add an item, remove an item, view the list, and exit.
For adding items, prompt the user for the item name and append it to shopping_list.
For removing items, ask the user for the item name and remove it from shopping_list. If the item is not found, display a message indicating so.
To view the list, print each item in shopping_list to the console.
Ensure your script handles invalid menu choices gracefully.

########################date_time############################
Your task is to create a Python script named explore_datetime.py. This script will demonstrate your ability to use the datetime module for handling dates and times in Python.

Part 1: Display the Current Date and Time

Research how to use the datetime module to obtain the current date and time.
Create a function with a name display_current_datetime and
save the current date inside a current_date variable
Format and print the current date and time in a readable format, such as “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS”.
Part 2: Calculate a Future Date

Prompt the user to enter a number of days (as an integer).
Create a function with a name calculate_future_date and
saves the future date inside a future_date variable
Calculate what the date will be after adding the specified number of days to the current date.
Print the future date in a format like “YYYY-MM-DD”.
Guidance:
Start by importing the necessary components from the datetime module.
Look into the datetime.now() function to get the current date and time.
Use timedelta(days=number_of_days) to represent the duration to add to the current date.
Remember, Python’s official documentation is an excellent resource for learning how to use the standard library modules.

###########################library_system.py & main_librarysystem.py###################
Develop two Python scripts: library_system.py and main.py. In library_system.py, you’ll define a base class Book and two derived classes, EBook and PrintBook, showcasing inheritance. Additionally, implement a Library class demonstrating composition by managing a collection of books.

library_system.py:
Base Class - Book:

Attributes: title (str) and author (str).
Method: __init__(self, title, author) for initializing book attributes.
Derived Classes - EBook and PrintBook:

Both classes inherit from Book.
EBook additional attribute: file_size (int).
PrintBook additional attribute: page_count (int).
Each derived class should have its own __init__ method that properly calls the base class __init__ while also initializing its unique attribute.
Composition - Library:

Attributes: books (a list to store instances of Book, EBook, and PrintBook).
Methods:
add_book(self, book): Adds a Book, EBook, or PrintBook instance to the library.
list_books(self): Prints details of each book in the library.

##############################polymorphism_demo & main_polymorph.py##########################
You are tasked with creating a Python script named polymorphism_demo.py. In this script, define a base class Shape with a method area() and derived classes Rectangle and Circle, each overriding the area() method to calculate their respective areas.

polymorphism_demo.py:
Base Class - Shape:

Method: area(self), which simply raises a NotImplementedError, indicating that derived classes need to override this method.
Derived Class - Rectangle:

Inherits from Shape.
Attributes: length and width.
Overrides the area() method to calculate the rectangle’s area using the formula: length × width.
Derived Class - Circle:

Inherits from Shape.
Attributes: radius.
Overrides the area() method to calculate the circle’s area using the formula: π × radius² (use math.pi for π).
